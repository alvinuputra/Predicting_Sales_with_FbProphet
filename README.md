# Predicting_Sales_with_Fbprophet

Predicting Sales With Fbprophet is a project using the python programming language that aims to predict future sales of a product using the Fbprophet library.

## Installation

This project can basically be run on any computer by opening the main.ipynb file with the desired notebook (Example : Jupyter Notebook, Google Colaboratory, Kaggle Notebook, etc.)

But if you want to develop it again with the same settings as the developer had during the production process. Then you can create a virtual environment (You can use other methods, the methods below are not required to be followed!)

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment

```bash
. venv/bin/activate
```

Install the required packages for these project.

```bash
pipe install -r requirement.txt
```
